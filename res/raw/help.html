<h1>Welcome!</h1>
The goal of the game is to guess a 4 color secret code chosen by the computer.<br/>
<br/>
After each guess, the computer will give you a hint to tell you how close you are to the correct code.<br/>
The hint will contain a <font color="red"><b>red</b></font> peg for each correct color AND position, and a <b>white</b>
peg for each correct color but incorrect position.<br/>
<br/>
For instance: if the secret code is PURPLE GREEN YELLOW ORANGE, and you guessed PURPLE YELLOW RED RED, the computer will give
you one <font color="red"><b>red</b></font> peg for PURPLE (correct color AND position) - and one <b>white</b> peg for YELLOW
(color present in the code, but not at the correct position).
<br/>
Note: the order of the pegs in the hint is not important!<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have this hint, you can try again to guess the secret code. If you find it in less than 12 guesses, you have one the game!

<h1>How to play</h1>
To play you can either tap (or click with trackball) on an empty hole and then chose a color,
or use the picker on top of the board, and drag and drop to the hole.<br/>
When you have chosen the 4 colors of your guess, press the 'OK' button.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, code breaker!
