<h1>Welcome!</h1>
The goal of the game is to guess a 4 color secret code chosen by the computer.<br/>
<br/>
After each guess, the computer will give you a hint to tell you how close you are to the correct code.<br/>
The hint will contain a <font color="red"><b>red</b></font> peg for each correct color AND position, and a <b>white</b>
peg for each correct color but incorrect position.<br/>
<br/>
For instance: if the secret code is:<br/>
<font color="purple">PURPLE</font> <font color="green">GREEN</font> <font color="yellow">YELLOW</font> <font color="orange">ORANGE</font>,<br/>
and you guessed:<br/>
<font color="purple">PURPLE</font> <font color="yellow">YELLOW</font> <font color="red">RED RED</font>,<br/>
the computer will give you:
<ul>
<li>one <font color="red"><b>red</b></font> peg for <font color="purple">PURPLE</font> (correct color AND position)</li>
<li>one <b>white</b> peg for <font color="yellow">YELLOW</font> (color present in the code, but not at the correct position).</li>
</ul>
Note: the order of the hint pegs is not important!<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have this hint, you can try again to guess the secret code.<br/>
<br/>
If you find it in less than 12 guesses, you have won the game!

<h1>How to play</h1>
You start with the top, highlighted row.<br/>
Either tap (or click with the trackball) on a hole and then pick a color,
or use the picker on top of the board to <i>drag and drop</i> to a hole.<br/>
When you have chosen the 4 colors of your guess, press the <b>OK</b> button.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Good luck, code breaker!</i>
